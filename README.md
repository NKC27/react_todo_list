# React ToDo List Application

I have created a React To Do List where the user is able to add, update & delete tasks they have entered.
I decided to make this because it is a very useful tool for users who have multiple tasks that need completing and this way
you can manage these tasks easily.

## Tech Used 

* FontAwesome
* Bootstrap (REACT)
* Nodemon 
* gh-Pages - Git deployment
