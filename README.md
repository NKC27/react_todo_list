# React ToDo List Application

I have created a React To Do List where the user is able to add, update & delete tasks they have entered.
I decided to make this because it is a very useful tool for users who have multiple tasks that need completing and this way
you can manage these tasks easily. It is also a responsive application, so it can be used on mobile devices when the user is on the move.

## Tech Used 

* FontAwesome
* Bootstrap (REACT)
* Nodemon 
* gh-Pages - Git deployment
* React framework
* Visual Basic Code Editor

## Description

• The user can enter the task into the input area at the top off the application.
• Once they have entered the information they will click "add" which will add it to the list with numbering.
• The user will have 3 options with each numbered task. complete/uncomplete, Edit/Update and delete.

## Future development

• Drag and drop task position in order of importance.
• Share with friends and family or work colleagues/ teams.
• Video/image input for tasks.
